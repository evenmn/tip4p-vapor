Once a point (T0, P0) on the coexistence curve is determined, we can use the Clapeyron equation,
!bt
d(\beta\mu)=hd\beta+\beta vdp
!et
to find other points along the coexistence curve. Here, $\beta=1/kT$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, $h$ is the molar enthalpy, $v$ is the volume and $p$ is the pressure. After a system consisting of two boxes has equilibrated in Gibbs ensemble, $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta$, $p_1=p_2=p$ and $\mu_1=\mu_2$. Thus, $d(\beta_1\mu_1)=d(\beta_2\mu_2)$ and we obtain the useful relation
!bt
h_1d\beta+\beta v_1dp=h_2d\beta +\beta v_2dp,
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\left(\frac{dp}{d\beta}\right)_{\sigma}=-\frac{\Delta h}{\beta\Delta v},
!et
where $\Delta h = h_2 - h_1$ and $\Delta v = v_2 - v_1$. In this equation, the right-hand side is independent of $p$ (and then also the left-hand side), but to proceed further, we need to define differential equation that is dependent on both $p$ and $\beta$. We can use the relation
!bt
\frac{d\ln p}{d\beta}=\frac{1}{p}\frac{dp}{d\beta}
!et
to define a differential equation that fulfills our requirements:
!bt
\left(\frac{d\ln p}{d\beta}\right)_{\sigma}=-\frac{\Delta h}{\beta p\Delta v}\equiv f(\beta, p).
!et
We solve this equation numerically by going moving along the coexistence curve step-by-step with step length $\delta\beta$. This means that $\beta_i=\beta_{i-1}+\delta\beta$. We approximate
!bt
\frac{d\ln p_i}{d\beta}\approx\frac{\ln p_i-\ln p_{i-1}}{\delta\beta}=f(\beta_{i-1},p_{i-1})\equiv f_{i-1}
!et
such that
!bt
\ln p_i=\ln p_{i-1} + \delta\beta f_{i-1},
!et
or
!bt
p_i=p_{i-1}\exp(\delta\beta f_{i-1}).
!et
This is a first estimate of the pressure. However, this is poor as we only used the old $f$-value in our calculation. To get a better estimate, can we now calculate
!bt
f_i=f(\beta_i, p_i)=\frac{\Delta h}{\beta_i p_i\Delta v}
!et
and get a better estimate of $p_i$ by calculating
!bt
\ln p_i=\ln p_{i-1} + \frac{\delta\beta}{2}(f_i+f_{i-1}).
!et
This is known as a predictor-corrector method, and it is possible to do more corrections to get an even better estimate of $p_i$. We can continue integrating along the coexistence curve until we reach 1 atm pressure. The corresponding $T$ is the critical temperature between our two phases at conditions like on the Earth's surface.

======= Scaling and units =======
So far, we have not discussed how the equations can be scaled or which units to use. Actually, we should have scales the equation before introducing $\ln$, as $\ln$ can only take dimensionless quantities. The typical way to scale such a expression, is to define a unit pressure as $p_0$, a unit volume as $v_0$, a unit energy as $\varepsilon_0$ and a unit reciprocal temperature $\beta_0$. Then, we can introduce massless quantities $p'=p/p_0$, $\Delta v'=\Delta v/v_0$, $\Delta h'=\Delta h/\varepsilon_0$ and $\beta'=\beta/\beta_0$. By inserting these quantities into the expression above, we observe that it can be rewritten as
!bt
\left(\frac{dp'}{d\beta'}\right)_{\sigma}=-\frac{\Delta h'}{\beta'\Delta v'}\cdot\frac{\varepsilon_0}{p_0v_0}.
!et
The final fraction here is dimensionless.

For our simulations, the pressure is typically around 1 atm, a typical length scale is Å and the energy can be measured in kcal. A convenient scaling would therefore be:

* $p_0=1\text{ bar}=100\text{ kPa}=1\cdot 10^5\text{ N/m}^2$
* $v_0=1\text{ Å}^3=1\cdot10^{-30}\text{ m}^3$
* $\varepsilon_0=1\text{ kcal/mol}=1/(4184\text{ J}\cdot N_A)=1/(4184\text{ Nm}\cdot 6.022\cdot10^{23})$
* $\beta_0=1/\text{k}_{\text{B}}\text{K}=1.380649\cdot10^{-23}\text{ J}^{-1}=1.380649\cdot10^{-23}\text{ Nm}^{-1}$

such that
!bt
C\equiv\frac{\varepsilon_0}{p_0v_0}=0.0039687835
!et

This conversion factor can also be used in the latter representation, which is actually used in the computations:
!bt
\left(\frac{d\ln p'}{d\beta'}\right)_{\sigma}=-C\frac{\Delta h'}{\beta' p'\Delta v'}\equiv f(\beta', p').

Once a point (T0, P0) on the coexistence curve is determined, we can use the Clapeyron equation,
!bt
d(\beta\mu)=hd\beta+\beta vdp
!et
to find other points along the coexistence curve. Here, $\beta=1/kT$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, $h$ is the molar enthalpy, $v$ is the volume and $p$ is the pressure. After a system consisting of two boxes has equilibrated in Gibbs ensemble, $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta$, $p_1=p_2=p$ and $\mu_1=\mu_2$. Thus, $d(\beta_1\mu_1)=d(\beta_2\mu_2)$ and we obtain the useful relation
!bt
h_1d\beta+\beta v_1dp=h_2d\beta +\beta v_2dp,
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\left(\frac{dp}{d\beta}\right)_{\sigma}=-\frac{\Delta h}{\beta\Delta v},
!et
where $\Delta h = h_2 - h_1$ and $\Delta v = v_2 - v_1$. In this equation, the right-hand side is independent of $p$ (and then also the left-hand side), but to proceed further, we need to define differential equation that is dependent on both $p$ and $\beta$. We can use the relation
!bt
\frac{d\ln p}{d\beta}=\frac{1}{p}\frac{dp}{d\beta}
!et
to define a differential equation that fulfills our requirements:
!bt
\left(\frac{d\ln p}{d\beta}\right)_{\sigma}=-\frac{\Delta h}{\beta p\Delta v}=f(\beta, p).
!et
We solve this equation numerically by going moving along the coexistence curve step-by-step with step length $\delta\beta$. This means that $\beta_i=\beta_{i-1}+\delta\beta$. We approximate
!bt
\frac{d\ln p_i}{d\beta}\approx\frac{\ln p_i-\ln p_{i-1}}{\delta\beta}=f(\beta_{i-1},p_{i-1})\equiv f_{i-1}
!et
such that
!bt
\ln p_i=\ln p_{i-1} + \delta\beta f_{i-1},
!et
or
!bt
p_i=p_{i-1}\exp(\delta\beta f_{i-1}).
!et
This is a first estimate of the pressure. However, this is poor as we only used the old $f$-value in our calculation. To get a better estimate, can we now calculate
!bt
f_i=f(\beta_i, p_i)=\frac{\Delta h}{\beta_i p_i\Delta v}
!et
and get a better estimate of $p_i$ by calculating
!bt
\ln p_i=\ln p_{i-1} + \frac{\delta\beta}{2}(f_i+f_{i-1}).
!et
This is known as a predictor-corrector method, and it is possible to do more corrections to get an even better estimate of $p_i$. We can continue integrating along the coexistence curve until we reach 1 atm pressure. The corresponding $T$ is the critical temperature between our two phases at conditions like on the Earth's surface.

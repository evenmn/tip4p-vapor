Molecular dynamics (MD) modelling might be the most popular technique for atomistic modelling as it is able to model a long range of physical systems. The approach is to solve the equation of motion,

\frac{d^2\boldsymbol{r}}{dt^2}=\frac{\boldsymbol{F}_{\text{net}}}{m},

using numerical integration. Here, $\boldsymbol{r}$ are the positions, $\boldsymbol{F}_{\text{net}}$ is the net force acting on the particles and $m$ are the masses. The force is found from differentiating the inter-particle potential, which again often is found from quantum mechanical computations. Given a realistic inter-atomic potential, the hope is that the system also behaves realistically.

In our case, the system of interest is water. Many water force-fields have been proposed, some better than other. The large number of force-fields indicates that it is hard to find a potential that model water realistically, which again indicates that water is a very complicated substance. TIP4P/2005 cite{vegaabascal} is currently among the most popular water force-fields due to its tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency. It is the model that we will apply here.

One of the reasons why water is hard to simulate is the relatively large surface tension. Usually when we simulate water, we avoid this by applying periodic boundary conditions in all directions. However, when simulating liquid-vapor coexistence, we necessarily need an interface between the phases, which has to be a surface. We can reduce the surface by making the system very narrow:

FIGURE: [../fig/md_sim/two_phases.png, width=1000 frac=0.8] Molecular dynamics simulation of liquid-vapor coexistence at 400K. \label{fig:twophases}

but even for this system a large amount of the particles are on or close to the surface. It turns out that even for a system of 1.000.000 molecules, 6% of the particles are surface particles cite{frenkelsmit}. In other words, it is especially hard to simulate the liquid-vapor coexistence of water using molecular dynamics simulations. It is important to stress that this is a physical property of water, and is not about the simulations being wrong. Typically, small water systems tend to boil at a way too high temperature. For the system above, the boiling point was found to be at 610K.

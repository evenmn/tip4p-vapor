Now as we have described the Monte Carlo simulations, we need to choose simulations ensemble. We have already mentioned that ordinary Monte Carlo simulations model the NVT ensemble. Is it this ensemble that we want to study? The answer is yes and no. Yes because we want to hold N, V and T constant. No because we will not study a normal NVT ensemble.

To avoid the surface tension, we will not have an interface in our simulation. Instead, the two phases will be simulated in separate boxes which both have periodic boundary conditions. The total number of particles is held constant, but the particles might be swapped between the two boxes to keep the chemical potential equal in both boxes. Similarly, the total volume is held constant, but the two boxes are allowed to exchange volume in order to hold the pressure equal in both boxes. This is known as Gibbs ensemble.

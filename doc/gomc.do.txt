GEMC simulations using GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC). This package looks promising as it claims to be GPU optimized. It is also implemented i C++, which is a advantage if I need to implement new features.

The file formats used are Proteindatabank (PDB) for particle configurations and Particle Structure File (PSF) for charges, masses, bonds and angles. PDB files can easily be generated using Packmol, while PSF files are usually generated by the function PSFgen implemented in VMD. To enable automatized operations, we have made a GOMC Python interface which supports the most essential GOMC functions (generating configuration files, parameter files, topology files, PSF files and running GOMC).

One of the main reasons why we chosen this package over the other packages, was the expected high performance. Albeit the package has a lower wall-clock time than Cassandra and Towhee when it is run on a powerful CPU (Nvidia Tesla P100), it is still not as fast as hoped.

Typically, 200-300 moves are accepted per second, which is not that many. One of the reasons is that only about 50% of the moves are accepted, which indicates that some of the configurations should be changed. Below 1% of the swap moves are accepted. Furthermore, the volume exchange seems to be extremely expensive.

Here, we have used:

* $P_{\text{trans}}=0.60$
* $P_{\text{rot}}=0.28$
* $P_{\text{vol}}=0.02$
* $P_{\text{par}}=0.10$

What we need from a GEMC simulation, is the pressure after equilbration and the final densities. We expect the pressure in the two boxes to be the same if the system has converged. If we plot the time-averaged pressure, we get a plot that looks like this:

We can obviously see that the system has not converged.
